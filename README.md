What This Program Does

This is a simple program that keeps track of gamers and their scores.
It stores their username, how many points they have, and how many 
games they played.


What You Can Do

- Add new gamers to the system
- See all the gamers
- Search for a specific gamer by name
- Sort gamers by their points or games played
- Save everything to a file so it doesn't disappear
- The program checks if you type something wrong


What I Used to Build This

- C# programming language
- Visual Studio
- Unit tests to make sure it works
- Files to save the data


How the Program is Organized

The program has three main parts:
- Gamer.cs - Stores information about one gamer
- GamerDatabase.cs - Manages all the gamers and sorting
- Program.cs - The menu you see on screen
- UnitTest1.cs - Tests to check everything works


What I Learned

- How to hide data using private and public
- How to store many gamers in a list
- How to search through the list to find someone
- How to sort the list from highest to lowest
- How to save and load files
- How to stop the program from crashing when you type wrong things
- How to test my code to make sure it works


How to Run This Program

1. Open the project in Visual Studio

Testing

I made 8 tests to check if the program works correctly.
All 8 tests passed successfully.
